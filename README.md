# Fullstack MERN Web Application

This is a Fullstack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The app includes user management, authentication, and authorization functionalities, as well as file upload features. This project demonstrates how to connect React with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build a complete, production-ready web application.

## Technologies Used:
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing user data and other application data.
- **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js to build the RESTful API.
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend server logic.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** – For user authentication and authorization.
- **Cloud Deployment** – Hosted on platforms like Heroku or Netlify.

## Features:
- **User Authentication:** Secure signup, login, and token-based authentication.
- **User Authorization:** Control access to certain resources based on user roles.
- **File Upload:** Support for file uploads (images) in both React and Node/Express.
- **State Management:** Managed app state efficiently with React Hooks and Context API.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-first design, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deployed the app to the cloud for live production.

## Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- MongoDB running locally or an Atlas MongoDB cloud database account.
